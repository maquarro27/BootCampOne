	<h1>MY FIRST WEB PAGE</h1>


		<p> This is my first attempt at designing my own web page I still don't have any idea what I am doing.</p>

		<p> This is my first attempt at a hyperlink to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a> one of my favorite sites.
		Sweet it worked!</p>
	 <br>

	 <h1>NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!</h1>
	 <p>Muuhahah!</p>

	 <p>How we accomplish this?</p>

	 <ol> 
	 	<li>We need a trained monkey or a teenager to show us how to do it</li>
	 	<li>We need spoons</li>
	 	<li>Have back up spoons</li>
	 </ol>

	 <p>Well mabey the spoon takes this a little too far, but you get the gist.<br>
	  Seriously though, spoons have awsome power, they made Rosie O'Donnell fat.</p>
